                        <p class="paragraph">Hi, I'm Andriy, a passionate student and lifelong learner. I have always been fascinated by technology and how it shapes the world.
                             From a young age, I knew I wanted to build things that could make people's lives easier, and that's what led me to pursue a career
                              in programming.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">Currently, I am focusing on learning C++, HTML, and CSS. Although I'm just starting my journey in the world of programming, I am
                             eager to dive deeper into these languages and build a solid foundation. My main focus right now is on mastering C++ to develop
                              efficient and scalable applications, while also learning the essentials of web development with HTML and CSS.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">In addition to programming, I am also passionate about design and user interfaces. I enjoy making sure that the applications I
                             create are not only functional but also intuitive and user-friendly. I believe that good design is just as important as good code,
                              and I strive to find a balance between both.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">As I continue to grow in my career, I am constantly exploring new technologies and tools. I am particularly interested in artificial
                             intelligence and machine learning, and I look forward to exploring these fields once I have a stronger understanding of programming
                              concepts. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">In my free time, I enjoy reading about the latest tech trends, playing video games, and experimenting with new development tools.
                             I also like to stay active, whether it's through hiking, cycling, or just enjoying a good walk. I believe that balancing work and
                              play is key to staying productive and motivated.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph">Ultimately, my goal is to create technology that not only solves problems but also makes a positive impact on people's lives. I am
                             excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead, and I look forward to continuing to learn, grow, and contribute to
                              the world of technology.</p>
